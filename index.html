    <h1>Shirley's Personal Site</h1>
    <p><em>Software Developer</em></p>
    <p>As a recent graduate of Turing School of Software and Design, I am excited to bring my newly honed skills and enthusiasm to a backend developer role. With a strong foundation in computer science concepts and practical experience building and maintaining web applications, I am confident in my ability to contribute to a team. In my studies, I have gained a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and have experience using Postman for API testing. I am also proficient in the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern and have experience working with SQL databases.
  
    In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for problem solving. I am an advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and have experience writing unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and reliability of my code. My drive and dedication were recognized when my team took 2nd place in my school's Demo Competition, where we showcased a web application that we built and presented to a panel of industry professionals.
  
    I have gained experience working on a team and am comfortable collaborating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am a strong communicator and am able to effectively translate technical concepts to a non-technical audience. I am excited to find a dynamic and fast-paced environment where I can continue to grow and develop as a developer, and where I can make a meaningful contribution to a team.</p>
